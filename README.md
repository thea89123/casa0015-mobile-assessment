This is the Final assessment template for CASA0015. 
Android APP to track family and exchange urgent communication

## Background
With extreme weather events likely to become more frequent and severe as a result of global warming and increased changes in air tables, this app provides a convenient, real-time way for people to find out weather information and respond to extreme weather.
The app can also be used as an essential tool for travelling and travel, helping users to better plan and schedule their trips and avoid unnecessary weather risks and surprises. 
Whether in everyday life or when travelling, this App provides useful weather information and warning services to help users better adapt to weather changes and keep themselves safe. 
At the same time, with the development of technology, real-time weather data and map information can also help people to better understand the impact of the weather in order to make more scientific and rational decisions. 
Therefore, this app aims to provide users with comprehensive, real-time weather information and warning functions to help them better understand and prevent the possible impact of weather on their lives.


### Storyboard

On a sunny morning, a city dweller named Ming opened his Weather Alert App. he first logged into his account and went to the main screen.

Ming saw the live weather data for his city and he noticed that the temperature today was much higher than usual. He continued to browse through the other features on the app and he used the search function to check the weather conditions in the city he was about to travel to in order to prepare for his trip.

Suddenly, Ming received an extreme weather warning notification informing him that there would be heavy rainfall in the city this afternoon. Ming felt very grateful as this gave him enough time to take precautions to keep him safe.

Ming continued to use the app and checked the temperature heat map in the live map. He saw that certain areas were particularly hot, reminding him to take care of his health in the hot weather.

Ming then went to the trip planning page of the app and entered his departure and destination, travel dates and number of days for the trip. The App then automatically fetched the weather data for both cities and displayed it to Ming.
After he completed the trip plan, the App automatically generated a trip details page. On this page, Ming could view the exact itinerary for each day, including weather conditions, transport suggestions and suggestions of places to visit. This allows him to better plan his trip and ensures that he can stay safe and comfortable during his journey.

In the end, Ming was satisfied that he had been given comprehensive weather information, warning notices and his trip details to better plan his life and travel, as well as to take appropriate precautions to protect his health and safety and that of his family.

## Challenges and Future improvement

Challenges:
1. Accuracy and reliability of weather data is a major challenge for the Weather Alert App due to uncertainty in weather forecasts and rapid changes in weather conditions.
2. Developing new and innovative features, such as air quality monitoring and pollen counts, can provide users with even more useful and relevant information that can impact their health and well-being.

Improvements:
1. In terms of future improvements, the Weather Alert App can provide more personalized weather information and recommendations based on each user's preferences and behavior. For example, the app could analyze a user's travel history and provide tailored advice on what to pack, what kind of transport to take, and what activities to do based on the weather conditions in the destination city.
2. Another potential improvement is to integrate social features into the app, such as allowing users to share their travel plans and weather conditions with friends and family. This could increase user engagement and help the app to grow its user base.
