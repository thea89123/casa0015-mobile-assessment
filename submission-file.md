## Introduction to Application

With extreme weather events likely to become more frequent and severe as a result of global warming and increased changes in air tables, this app provides a convenient, real-time way for people to find out weather information and respond to extreme weather. The app can also be used as an essential tool for travelling and travel, helping users to better plan and schedule their trips and avoid unnecessary weather risks and surprises. Whether in everyday life or when travelling, this App provides useful weather information and warning services to help users better adapt to weather changes and keep themselves safe. At the same time, with the development of technology, real-time weather data and map information can also help people to better understand the impact of the weather in order to make more scientific and rational decisions. Therefore, this app aims to provide users with comprehensive, real-time weather information and warning functions to help them better understand and prevent the possible impact of weather on their lives. 

The main screen displays live weather data for the user's current location, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Users can also use the search function to check weather conditions in other areas. 

The real-time map function includes a temperature heat map that helps users to better understand the weather conditions in different areas.

Additionally, the trip planning page allows users to enter their departure and destination, travel dates, and number of days. 

Future updates to the app will include an automatic retrieval and display of weather data for departure and destination based on user input, as well as an automatically generated trip details page.
